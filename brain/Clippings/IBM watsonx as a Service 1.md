## Read about prompting a foundation model

Foundation models are very large AI models. They have billions of parameters and are trained on terabytes of data. Foundation models can perform a variety of tasks, including text-, code-, or image generation, classification, conversation, and more. Large language models are a subset of foundation models used for text- and code-related tasks. IBM watsonx.ai contains a collection of deployed large language models that you can use, as well as tools for experimenting with prompts.

Task 6: Adjust model parameters

To preview this task, watch the video beginning at 01:28.

You can experiment with changing decoding or stopping criteria parameters. Follow these steps to adjust model parameters.

Note: The model parameters vary based on the currently selected model.

The following table defines the model parameters available for the *flan-t5-xxl-11b* foundation model.

| Model parameters | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Decoding | Set decoding to *Greedy* to always select words with the highest probability. Set decoding to *Sampling* to customize the variability of word selection. |
| Temperature | Control the creativity of generated text. Higher values will lead to more randomly generated outputs. |
| Top P (nucleus sampling) | Set to `< 1.0` to use only the smallest set of most probable tokens with probabilities that add up to `top_p` or higher. |
| Top K | Set the number of highest probability vocabulary tokens to keep for top-k-filtering. Lower values make it less likely the model will go off topic. |
| Random seed | Control the random sampling of the generated tokens when sampling is enabled. Setting the random see to the same number for each generation ensures experimental repeatability. |
| Repetition penalty | Set a repetition penalty to counteract the model's tendency to repeat prompt text verbatim or get stuck in a loop. 1.00 indicates no penalty. |
| Stop sequences | Set stop sequences to one ore more strings to cause the text generation to stop if or when they are produced as part of the output. |
| Min tokens | Define the minimum number to tokens to generate. Stop sequences encountered prior to the minimum number of tokens being generated are ignored. |
| Max tokens | Define the maximum number to tokens to generate. |

1. Change the *Top K* parameter to `10` to make it less likely the model will go off topic.
2. Click **X** to delete the previous model output.
3. Click the same sample prompt from the list.
4. Click **Generate** to generate output using the new model parameters.
5. Click the **Session history** icon after submitting multiple prompts to view your session history.
6. Click any entry to work with a previous prompt, model specification, and parameter settings, and then click **Restore**.
7. Edit the prompt, change the model, or adjust decoding and stopping criteria parameters.
8. Click **Generate** to generate output using the updated information.
